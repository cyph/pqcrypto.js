NTS-KEM(12,64)

This directory contains the ANSI C reference implementation of NTS-KEM(12,64)
submitted to NIST as part of the Post-Quantum Cryptography Standardization
Process.


How to Build
------------
In order to build the code, run the following command:

make 

Note that the code here depends on OpenSSL development library. You may need
to adjust OPENSSLDIR and LIBCRYPTO variables in the 'Makefile' to suit your
platform.

Once the build is completed, you will have the following files:

./lib/libntskem-12-64.a   : a static library of NTS-KEM(12,64) code
./bin/ntskem-12-64-test   : a binary that tests key-gen, encap, decap and
                            check decap status for a number of iterations
./bin/ntskem-12-64-kat    : a binary that generates the required KAT file
./bin/ntskem-12-64-intval : a binary that in addition to generate the KAT
                            file, also produce intermediate values

The code here has been tested on gcc 4.9.2 and gcc 6.3 on Linux and clang-800
on OS X.


How to Generate the KAT Files
-----------------------------
The KAT files contain a pair of req and rsp files and these can be obtained
by executing the following command:

./bin/ntskem-12-64-kat

It may take a while to run. It produces PQCkemKAT_9216.req and 
PQCkemKAT_9216.rsp, which contains 100 runs of NTS-KEM key-generation,
encapsulation and decapsulation. The number of iterations can be changed
from nist/PQCgenKAT.c file, look for KATNUM macro.


How to Generate the Intermediate Values
---------------------------------------
The intermediate values may be obtained by executing the following command:

./bin/ntskem-12-64-intval

and the intermediate values are printed to stdout. Like the KAT files, the
binary produces the intermediate values of NTS-KEM key-generation,
encapsulation and decapsulation for 100 iterations.

Currently, the following intermediate values are output. The step numbers
are matched to NTS-KEM specifications (Section 3 of the supporting document).

Key-generation:
   Step 1. Randomly generated monic Goppa polynomial Gz. Each sampled Goppa 
           polynomial is shown, including its status (valid or invalid)
   Step 2. Random permutation vector p
   Step 3. Construct a generator matrix:
     (a) Vector a after permutation by p
     (b) Vector h after permutation by p
     (c) The parity-check matrix H (not in reduced-echelon form)
     (d) The parity-check matrix H (in reduced-echelon form)
     (d) Vectors p, a, h after potential column swapping introduced in (d)
     (e) The matrix Q
   Step 4. The vector a* (labelled a_ast) and h* (labelled h_ast)

Encapsulation:
   Step 1-2. Randomly error vector e.
   Step 3. The vector k_e = SHAKE256(e)
   Step 4. The message vector m
   Step 5. The two parts of the ciphertext: c_b and c_c
   Step 6. The vector k_r

Decapsulation:
   Step 1(a)-(c). The syndrome vector s
   Step 1(d). The output of Berlekamp-Massey algorithm: sigma and xi
   Step 1(e). The output of multipoint evaluation of sigma with FFT
   Step 1(f). The error vector e_prime
   Step 2. The permuted version of e_prime: vector e
   Step 3. The vector k_e, recovered from ciphertext and vector e
   Step 4. Output of SHAKE256(e) and vector k_r

Note that all random bytes are obtained using AES_CTR_DRBG (SP800-90A section 
10.2.1.5.1), initialised by the per-run 'seed' value.
