NTS-KEM(12,64)

This directory contains the ANSI C optimized implementation of NTS-KEM(12,64)
for SSE2/SSE4.1 platforms. The files in this directory are submitted to NIST 
as part of the Post-Quantum Cryptography Standardization Process.


How to Build
------------
In order to build the code, run the following command:

make 

Note that the code here depends on OpenSSL development library. You may need
to adjust OPENSSLDIR and LIBCRYPTO variables in the 'Makefile' to suit your
platform.

Once the build is completed, you will have the following files:

./lib/libntskem-12-64-sse2.a : a static library of NTS-KEM(12,64) code
./bin/ntskem-12-64-sse2-test : a binary that tests key-gen, encap, decap and
                               check decap status for a number of iterations
./bin/ntskem-12-64-sse2-kat  : a binary that generates the required KAT file

The code here has been tested on gcc 4.9.2 and gcc 6.3 on Linux and clang-800
on OS X.


How to Generate the KAT Files
-----------------------------
The KAT files contain a pair of req and rsp files and these can be obtained
by executing the following command:

./bin/ntskem-12-64-sse2-kat

It may take a while to run. It produces PQCkemKAT_9216.req and 
PQCkemKAT_9216.rsp, which contains 100 runs of NTS-KEM key-generation,
encapsulation and decapsulation. The number of iterations can be changed
from nist/PQCgenKAT.c file, look for KATNUM macro.
