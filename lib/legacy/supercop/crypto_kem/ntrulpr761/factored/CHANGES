Reverse-chronological changelog for ntrulpr*/factored:

Added abort if crypto_stream_aes256ctr() fails. (There are some AES
implementations that never fail, but OpenSSL can fail if it runs out of
memory.)

Used crypto_stream_aes256ctr_publicinputs() for the public generator.

Used CRYPTO_NAMESPACE.

Used crypto_verify_clen.

Rearranged variables for better stack usage.

Introduced ppadsort.

Factored out crypto_core_multsntrup761. (Same for other sizes.)

Special-cased reduction mod 3 for F3_freeze().
Special-cased reduction mod q for Fq_freeze().
Special-cased reduction mod q for Generator().
Delayed reduction inside multiplication.

Factored out crypto_encode_761x1531round. (Same for other sizes.)
Factored out crypto_{encode,decode}_761x1531. (Same for other sizes.)
Factored out crypto_{encode,decode}_761x3. (Same for other sizes.)
Factored out crypto_{encode,decode}_256x16.
Factored out crypto_{encode,decode}_256x2.
