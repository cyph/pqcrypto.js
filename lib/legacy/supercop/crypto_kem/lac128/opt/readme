1. Getting started
-------------------------
This file is an optimized implementation of our LAC algorithm. This program uses some functions of OpenSSl, so you need to install OpenSSL for running this program successfully. For building, just run:

         make 

         and then execute:

         ./lac

to see the command format.

There are four types of tests:
  - Test the speed of LAC. You can run:
	./lac speed
  - Test the cpucycles of LAC. You can run:
	./lac cpucycles
  - Test the correctness of LAC. You can run:
	./lac correctness
  - Test the speed of basic blocks used in lac. You can run:
	./lac basicblock

The test data is under just one security level. If you want to change security level, modify it in "lac_param.h". Change the third line as,
	
	#define LAC128

or 

	#define LAC192

or 
	
	#define LAC256

Supported platforms:
  Linux and Windows (with msys2).

2. Main modules
-------------------------
There are five main modules. 
  - ENCRYPT: the key generation, encryption and decryption algorithms, which is corresponding to LAC.CPA in the documentation.
  - KEM: The IND-CCA secure key encapsulation mechanism algorithms, which is corresponding to LAC.CCA in the documentation.
  - KE: the key exchange algorithm, which is corresponding to LAC.KE in the documentation.
  - AKE: the authenticated key exchange algorithm, which is corresponding to LAC.AKE in the documentation.
  - Basic: the randomness generator, pseudo-randomness generator, and hash function. These basic blocks mainly based on the functions supported by OpenSSL.

3 Parameters
-------------------------
According to current attacks, there are three sets of security parameters. 
  - LAC128: provides 1 and 2 security categories in NIST documentation.
  - LAC192: provides 3 and 4 security categories in NIST documentation.
  - LAC256: provides 5 security category in NIST documentation.
